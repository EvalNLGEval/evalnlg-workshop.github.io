**Announcement**: INLG 2020 and its workshops are organized virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More information soon.
{: .notice--danger}


The aim of this workshop is to discuss ideas about the evaluation of NLG systems. We encourage a range of papers ranging from commentary and meta-evaluation of existing evaluation strategies to the suggestion of new metrics. We specifically place emphasis on the methodology and linguistic aspects of evaluation rather than the proposal of new automatic metrics. We invite papers on any topic related to the evaluation of NLG systems, including (but not limited to):
* Qualitative studies, definitions of evaluation metrics (e.g., readability, fluency, semantic correctness)
* Crowdsourcing Strategies, qualitative tests for crowdsourcing (How to elucidate evaluation metrics?)
* Looking at individual differences and cognitive biases in human evaluation (expert vs. non-expert, L1 vs L2 speakers)
* Best practices for system evaluations (How does your lab choose models?)
* Qualitative study/error analysis approaches
* Demo: Systems that make the evaluation easier
* Comparison of metrics across different NLG tasks (captioning, data2text, story generation, summarization…) or different languages (with a focus on low-resource languages)
* Evaluation surveys
* Opinion pieces and commentary on trends in evaluation

We encourage the submission of “task proposals”, where authors can propose shared tasks for next year’s edition of the workshop.

### Unshared Task:

This year’s edition also features an unshared task: rather than working towards a specific goal, we encourage participants to use a specific collection of datasets, for any evaluation-related goal. For example: comparing a new evaluation method with existing ratings, or carrying out a subset analysis. This allows us to put the results from previous shared tasks in perspective, and helps us develop better evaluation metrics for future shared tasks. Working on the same datasets allows for more focused discussions at the workshop.

Datasets for this year’s edition are existing datasets with system outputs and human ratings. Participants may use any of these for their unshared task submission:
* [E2E NLG Challenge](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/E2E/)
* [WebNLG Challenge 2017](https://webnlg-challenge.loria.fr/challenge_2017/)
* [Surface Realization Shared Task (SRST) 2019](http://taln.upf.edu/pages/msr2019-ws/SRST.html)
